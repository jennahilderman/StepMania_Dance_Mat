# StepMania Dance Mat
I am developing a custom StepMania dance mat with an ESP32 microcontroller and designing a custom PCB to integrate high-resistance sensors made out of aluminum foil for accurate gameplay detection. The mat is made of wood and acrylic and includes USB and Bluetooth connectivity options.
